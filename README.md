Above is python and grasshopper starter code from our professor Michael Rivera for a 3D printing slicer. To which I, Christopher Griffin, Jon Ezell, and Chat-GPT collaborated on, that produces gcode that passes 23/25 of the class tests. However, it is important to note I have only been able to produce gcode from the test lines, for when I explode my polyline segments into 500 some-odd pieces my rhino software or hardware cannot handle that amount of 3D data and crashes, so I am curious it the Z-position tests would pass if the gcode actually had z-axis positions to consider. We are currently searching for a solution.
